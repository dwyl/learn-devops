We've made the switch to `Hetzner`,
we think you should too.

# Why?

After more than a decade using various "Cloud" providers
including all the _Big_ Tech (`AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`, `DigitalOcean`, `Linode`)
and many PaaS such as Lambda, Fly.io, Heroku, Vercel, etc.
we've finally bitten the bullet and gone _back_ to our roots; Servers!

## Brief Aside on Motivation

There two types of motivation: towards and away.
**Toward** is the **_positive_** motivation such as getting fit/healthy.
**Away** motivation is when we want to _avoid_ something, like being unfit.
Both types of motivation have their place.
Some people are exclusively motivated by loss/pain/risk aversion,
while others are driven by gain/reward/returns and downplay the downside.
I go through phases of being super risk averse
and others when I'm happy to take calculated risks
that others who haven't done the math think are _crazy_.

In the case of self-hosting our web apps on barebones servers,
we have _plenty_ of experience from the pre-AWS days.
Yes, this ages us, but the experience was formative.
And means I'm not afraid to dive in.

I'm motivated _away_ from the
[data loss]()
we experienced on `Fly.io`
and _toward_ the high availability/affordability of `Hetzner`.
I know this will require some setup/config work,
but I am not deterred
